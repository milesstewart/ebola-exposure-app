# The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Terms & Conditions of Use

Please read these terms of use carefully. The following Terms & Conditions of Use apply to the Ebola Exposure Window Calculator software and any related applications (collectively, "the App"). The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory is referred to in these Terms & Conditions of Use as JHU/APL, "we," "us" or "our." **THE APP IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN THE EVENT OF A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.**  **By accessing or using the App, you agree that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions of Use, as amended from time to time. If you do not wish to agree to these Terms & Conditions of Use, do not access or use any part of the App.**

JHU/APL reserves the right to take whatever lawful actions it may deem appropriate in response to actual or suspected violation of these Terms & Conditions of Use.

## **No Medical Advice**

**Call your health care provider or your local emergency number immediately if you have a medical emergency.** Always seek the advice of your physician, MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, or other qualified health care provider if you are CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR HEALTH or have any questions regarding symptoms or medical ISSUES.

The information that you obtain from the App is provided for informational purposes only.  THE APP DOES NOT MAKE ANY MEDICAL DIAGNOSES. The App is not intended to offer medical advice from JHU/APL. The App may provide you with information or facilitate your communication with a health care provider, but is not a substitute for the professional judgment of a health care provider.  NEVER DISREGARD A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL'S ADVICE OR CANCEL AN APPOINTMENT BECAUSE YOU ARE RELYING ON INFORMATION YOU HAVE OBTAINED FROM THE APP.

**No Warranty**

THE APP AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." JHU/APL DOES NOT MAKE AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, PROMISES OR GUARANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, JHU/APL, ITS AFFILIATES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS HEREBY DISCLAIM AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE APP, AND/OR CONTENT OR INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN APP.  JHU/APL SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE APP.

## **Estimate**

The App provides an **estimate** for a possible period of time during which a patient with the Ebola virus disease may have been exposed to the Ebola virus.  Accordingly, the App may be useful for calculating a potential period during which the patient may have been exposed to the Ebola virus.  Any information provided by the App must be used in context of other known information regarding the patient and is not meant to substitute for the independent medical judgment of a physician relative to diagnostic and treatment options of a specific patient's medical condition.  The true exposure window may be different from the window calculated by the App.  The accuracy of the App is dependent on the information provided to the App and the applicability of the underlying algorithms used in the App to the particular patient.

The algorithms used in the App to calculate the exposure window were adapted from the source code located at: [https://github.com/cdcArmstrong/ebola\_calc](https://github.com/cdcArmstrong/ebola_calc), which derived its calculations from Malvy et al. (2019). Ebola virus disease. _Lancet, 393_, 936-48. & Vel√°squez et al. (2015). Time From Infection to Disease and Infectiousness for Ebola Virus Disease, a Systematic Review. _Clinical Infectious Diseases, 61(7)_, 1135-40 (and 2019 supplemental material).

## **Privacy**

The App does not collect, permanently store, or transmit any personal data.  JHU/APL does not know the identity of users of the App.  All calculations of exposure windows are performed within the App without synchronization or data transmission to an external source.
